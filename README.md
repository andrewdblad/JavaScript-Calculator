# Overview

JavaScript is the language of the web and one of the most used languages in the world. I dove into this project with the purpose of learning more about the language.

This is a simple JavaScript calculator with the same format as most calculators in real life. It can perform simple mathmatical calculations.

This calculator can be used instead of a physical device and performs the same task.
